<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><pre class="  "><code>The sky is changed!—and such a change; Oh, night!  
And storm and darkness, ye are wond'rous strong,  
Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light  
Of a dark eye in woman! Far along  
From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,  
Leaps the lire thunder! Not from one lone cloud,  
But every mountain now hath found a tongue,  
And Jura answers thro' her misty shroud,  
Back to the joyous Alps who call to her aloud!  

And this is in the night:—Most glorious night!  
Thou wer't not sent for slumber! let me be  
A sharer in thy far and fierce delight,—  
A portion of the tempest and of me!  
How the lit lake shines a phosphoric sea,  
And the big rain comet dancing to the earth!  
And now again 'tis black,—and now the glee  
Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain mirth, </pre></div> </div>
