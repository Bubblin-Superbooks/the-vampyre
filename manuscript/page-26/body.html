Shall know the demon for their sire;  
As cursing thee, thou cursing them,  
Thy flowers are withered on the stem.  
But one that for thy crime must fall,  
The youngest, best beloved of all,  
Shall bless thee with a father's name—  
That word shall wrap thy heart in flame!  
Yet thou must end thy task and mark  
Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark,  
And the last glassy glance must view  
Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue;  
Then with unhallowed hand shall tear  
The tresses of her yellow hair,  
Of which, in life a lock when shorn  
Affection's fondest pledge was worn—  
But now is borne away by thee  
Memorial of thine agony! </pre></div> </div>
